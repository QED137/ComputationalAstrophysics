# Kepler's Equation Solver and Celestial Mechanics

This Python script explores solutions to Kepler's equation and demonstrates celestial mechanics calculations. It includes implementations of fixed-point iteration and Newton-Raphson methods to solve Kepler's equation, as well as exercises related to celestial bodies' orbital parameters.

## Contents

1. [Kepler's Equation Solver](#keplers-equation-solver)
2. [Celestial Mechanics](#celestial-mechanics)
    - [Exercise 1: Mercury and Halley](#exercise-1-mercury-and-halley)
    - [Exercise 2: Earth and Mars](#exercise-2-earth-and-mars)

## Kepler's Equation Solver

The script provides two methods for solving Kepler's equation:

- **Fixed-Point Iteration**
- **Newton-Raphson Method**

These methods are applied to calculate the eccentric anomaly, which is crucial in celestial mechanics.

## Celestial Mechanics

### Exercise 1: Mercury and Halley

The script explores the orbital parameters of Mercury and Halley's Comet. It calculates the eccentric anomaly, mean anomaly, and the number of iterations required for convergence using both fixed-point iteration and Newton-Raphson methods.

### Exercise 2: Earth and Mars

The second exercise involves calculating the mutual distance between Earth and Mars over time. It uses Kepler's equation solutions and celestial mechanics principles.

# Lane-Emden Equation Solver and Stellar System Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains also a numerical solver for the Lane-Emden equation, along with stability analysis tools. The Lane-Emden equation is a differential equation that describes the structure of self-gravitating, spherically symmetric polytropic fluids, such as stars.
## Lane-Emden Equation

The Lane-Emden equation is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{\xi^2} \frac{d}{d\xi} \left( \xi^2 \frac{d\theta}{d\xi} \right) + \theta^n = 0
$$

where $\theta(\xi)$ is a dimensionless function of the radial coordinate ξξ and nn is the polytropic index.

## NUmerical SOlver 

The numerical solver implemented in this repository utilizes [insert numerical method here, e.g., Runge-Kutta method] to approximate the solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The solver is designed to handle various polytropic indices and initial conditions.

## Stability Analysis

Dahlquist's test is a method used for the stability analysis of numerical methods applied to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It was introduced by Åke Björck and Germund Dahlquist. The main idea is to analyze the stability of a numerical method by applying it to a simple linear test equation with known solutions.

The linear test equation typically takes the form:

\[ y' = \lambda y \]

where \( y' \) is the derivative of \( y \) with respect to time, and \( \lambda \) is a complex constant. This test equation is chosen because it represents the simplest form of a linear ordinary differential equation with an exponential solution.

When applying a numerical method to this test equation, it leads to a difference equation of the form:

\[ y_{k+1} = R(h\lambda) y_k \]

Here, \( h \) is the step size, \( \lambda h \) is often denoted as \( \mu \), and \( R(h\lambda) \) is the stability function associated with the numerical method. The stability function characterizes how errors in the numerical solution behave over time.

The stability of the method is analyzed by examining the behavior of the stability function for different values of \( \mu \) in the complex plane. A method is considered stable if the absolute value of the stability function is bounded by 1 for all values of \( \mu \) in the left-half complex plane.

Dahlquist's test is particularly useful for one-step methods, such as explicit and implicit Euler methods, Runge-Kutta methods, and other numerical integrators. By studying the stability behavior through this test, researchers can gain insights into the numerical method's stability properties and choose appropriate methods for solving specific ODEs.
