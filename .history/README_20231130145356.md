# Kepler's Equation Solver and Celestial Mechanics

This Python script explores solutions to Kepler's equation and demonstrates celestial mechanics calculations. It includes implementations of fixed-point iteration and Newton-Raphson methods to solve Kepler's equation, as well as exercises related to celestial bodies' orbital parameters.

## Contents

1. [Kepler's Equation Solver](#keplers-equation-solver)
2. [Celestial Mechanics](#celestial-mechanics)
    - [Exercise 1: Mercury and Halley](#exercise-1-mercury-and-halley)
    - [Exercise 2: Earth and Mars](#exercise-2-earth-and-mars)

## Kepler's Equation Solver

The script provides two methods for solving Kepler's equation:

- **Fixed-Point Iteration**
- **Newton-Raphson Method**

These methods are applied to calculate the eccentric anomaly, which is crucial in celestial mechanics.

## Celestial Mechanics

### Exercise 1: Mercury and Halley

The script explores the orbital parameters of Mercury and Halley's Comet. It calculates the eccentric anomaly, mean anomaly, and the number of iterations required for convergence using both fixed-point iteration and Newton-Raphson methods.

### Exercise 2: Earth and Mars

The second exercise involves calculating the mutual distance between Earth and Mars over time. It uses Kepler's equation solutions and celestial mechanics principles.

### Exercise 3: Lane-Emden Equation and Physics of Stars

LAne Emden equation has been soved numerically and stability anlyses
